mRemoteNG is the next generation of mRemote, a full-featured, multi-tab remote connections manager.

It allows you to store all your remote connections in a simple yet powerful interface.

Currently these protocols are supported:

 * RDP (Remote Desktop)
 * VNC (Virtual Network Computing)
 * ICA (Independent Computing Architecture)
 * SSH (Secure Shell)
 * Telnet (TELecommunication NETwork)
 * HTTP/S (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
 * Rlogin (Rlogin)
 * RAW

mRemoteNG can be installed on Windows 7 or later.

Windows 7 systems require RDP version 8:

OR

Windows 8+ support RDP version 8+ out of the box.

RDP versions are backwards compatible, so an mRemoteNG client running on Windows 10 can connection successfully to a Windows 2003 host (for example).
