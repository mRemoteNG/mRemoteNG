mRemoteNG is the next generation of mRemote, a full-featured, multi-tab remote connections manager.

## Features

mRemoteNG is a fork of mRemote: an open source, tabbed, multi-protocol, remote connections manager. mRemoteNG adds bug fixes and new features to mRemote.

It allows you to view all of your remote connections in a simple yet powerful tabbed interface.

* RDP (Remote Desktop/Terminal Server)
* VNC (Virtual Network Computing)
* ICA (Citrix Independent Computing Architecture)
* SSH (Secure Shell)
* Telnet (TELecommunication NETwork)
* HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
* rlogin (Remote Login)
* Raw Socket Connections

For a detailed feature list and general usage support, refer to the [User Manual](https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/wiki/User-Manual).
