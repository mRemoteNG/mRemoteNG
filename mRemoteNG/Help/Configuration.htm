    <p class="heading1">
        First start</p>
<p>
        Once you got mRemote installed and run it for the first time you should see a 
        screen like on the following screenshot.</p>
<p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/01.png" /></p>
<p>
        The first thing that catches your attention will probably be the info box 
        popping up.<br />
        Don&#39;t freak out just yet, this is not a error message and it&#39;s totally ok to 
        show up on the first run.<br />
        It just tells you that the connections file could not be found at the default 
        location and that mRemote will create a new one for you at this location.<br />
        If you click anywhere else in the application the panel will hide itself again. 
        (Tip: You can also hit Escape to hide the Errors and Infos panel)</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/02.png" /></p>
    <p>
        Now that we now about the Errors and Infos panel take a deep breath and just 
        stare at the gorgeous about screen for a few seconds. =)<br />
        No, seriously, to create your first connection continue reading.</p>
    <p>
        <span class="heading1">Creating Connections</span></p>
    <p>
        Right click the root item (the blue ball labeled &quot;Connections&quot;) in the 
        Connections panel and select &quot;Add Connection&quot;.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/03.png" /></p>
    <p>
        A new item shows up under the root item. You can give it a name now (or rename 
        it later). I just named mine &quot;Test&quot;.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/04.png" /></p>
    <p>
        Now have a look at the Config panel in the bottom left, just under the 
        Connections panel.</p>
<p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/05.png" /></p>
<p>
        As you may notice this is where you configure all the properties of connections 
        and folders.<br />
        There are a lot of values that can be set but for our first connection we will 
        keep things simple.</p>
<p>
        The most important things right now are that we tell the application which host 
        we want to connect to and which protocol we want to use.<br />
        In this example I will use a Windows 2003 server that has RDP (Remote Desktop 
        Protocol) enabled.<br />
        As RDP is the default protocol whenever you create a new connection I don&#39;t have 
        to change anything there.</p>
<p>
        The next thing I&#39;ll do is to fill the Hostname/IP field with the hostname I 
        want to connect to.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/06.png" /></p>
    <p>
        I&#39;ll also fill the Username and Password fields so I will be automatically 
        logged on to the server.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/07.png" /></p>
    <p>
        Ok, that&#39;s it, we are ready for our first connection test.</p>
    <p>
        <span class="heading1">Opening and Closing Connections</span></p>
    <p>
        There are multiple ways to open a connection in mRemote, but the easiest is to 
        just double-click the connection in the Connections panel.</p>
    <p>
        If I do that now, a new panel named &quot;General&quot; with one tab inside named &quot;Test&quot; 
        will show up.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/08.png" /></p>
    <p>
        Alright, mRemote is now trying to connect to the specified host.</p>
    <p>
        If it cannot connect you will see a message popping up like on the following 
        screenshot.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/17.png" /></p>
    <p>
        This for example means the hostname cannot be resolved.</p>
    <p>
        Instead, if all goes well you should see the remote desktop.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/09.png" /></p>
    <p>
        If you do not want to log off from the remote machine but just close it you can 
        do this by simply double-clicking the tab labeled &quot;test&quot; or just close the whole 
        &quot;General&quot; panel by clicking the small &quot;x&quot; in the upper right corner.</p>
    <p>
        <span class="heading1">Folders and Inheritance</span></p>
    <p>
        Folders in mRemote cannot only be used to categorize connections but also to 
        apply properties to the underlying connections.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Example:</b><br />
        You have 10 Remote Desktop enabled servers in one domain and 15 in another 
        domain.<br />
        Normally you would spend a lot of time creating all those connections and 
        setting the individual properties like username, password, etc.<br />
        In mRemote there is an easier way. You just create two folders, one for domain A 
        and one for domain B and set all properties there.<br />
        Then create the Connections and let them inherit every property. The only 
        properties left to fill on Connection basis are the Connection&#39;s name and 
        hostname. Everything else will be inherited from the parent folder.</p>
    <p>
        &quot;Sounds cool, but how to do it?&quot;<br />
        I&#39;ll show you how to do it!</p>
    <p>
        First add a new folder.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/10.png" /></p>
    <p>
        Then give it a name and fill all the properties you need (just like you did with 
        the test Connection).</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/11.png" /></p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/12.png" /></p>
    <p>
        When you&#39;re done setting the values you can either just drag the test Connection 
        inside the folder or create a new one.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/13.png" /></p>
    <p>
        Right now nothing has changed and nothing will be inherited.<br />
        To enable inheritance switch to the inheritance view by clicking the dedicated 
        button.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/14.png" /></p>
    <p>
        The properties that show up now are almost the same as before, but you can only 
        select yes or no.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/15.png" /></p>
    <p>
        When no is selected the property will not be inherited, yes indicates an 
        inherited property.<br />
        For this test set &quot;Inherit Everything&quot; to Yes.</p>
    <p>
        Now if you switch back to the properties view (the button left of the 
        inheritance button) you should see that not much is left of all those 
        properties.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/16.png" /></p>
    <p>
        Only the Name and Hostname/IP properties are left over, everything else will be 
        inherited from the parent folder.<br />
        Of course you can also only let some of the properties be inherited.</p>
    <p>
        Just play around with this a bit and you&#39;ll get the hang of it.</p>
