mRemoteNG is using tabs and panels to stay organized but also to create
a better view of all multitasking that is being done inside the application.


Explanation
============

Panels are used to organize tabbed conections. This might seem a bit confusing
at first glance but is a great way to stay organized. Below is a few examples
of how to use panels to give you a hands on better view of them:

- *Test and Production* - You can add 2 panels where you have test servers in one panel and production connections in the other

- *Datacenters* - Maybe you want to divide panels into different datacenters

- *Temp project* - To see all servers you work on for a temporary project

- *Home vs Work* - Or divide them up into where home connections are and work connections are located

As you can see the panels organization do have benefits to it.
Below you will see a screenshot of a organized view where Domain A
is in panel 1 and Domain B is in panel 2.

   Example two panels created with Domain A and Domain B

The function of a panel works as a sort of workspace.


Creating Panels

automatic when making connections. However you can also create panels manually.
