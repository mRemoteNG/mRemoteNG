Backup and Recovery
===================

By default, your connections file is backed up every time it is saved.
These backup files are normal/valid connections file - they have only been renamed to avoid being overwritten.
mRemoteNG will save the 10 most recent backups.

Files and Locations
-------------------

Your backup files are located in the same place as your normal connections file.
This could be one of three places:

- Normal version: `%AppData%\mRemoteNG`
- Portable version: In the same location as mRemoteNG.exe
- If you have saved your confCons.xml to a custom location, go there.

There are 2 different backup naming schemes:

- `confCons.xml.backup` is the most recent backup that was taken.
- `confCons.xml.YYYYMMDD-HHmmssxxxx.backup` is a rolling backup that was moved to a rolling backup file on the date specified in the file name.

Recovering corrupted connections file
-------------------------------------

If you find that your confCons.xml file has corrupted or has lost its data,
you will need to revert to a previous version.

- Locate your confCons.xml file
- Find the most recent backup file that appears to have data (>1KB in size).
- Rename or delete the corrupted `confCons.xml` file.
- Rename the chosen backup file to remove the date stamp and .backup suffix. Unless you set a custom path, your backup file should now be named `confCons.xml`.
