    <h1>First Run</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Here is a quick reference of the interface:
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshots/Reference/01.png">
    <p>
      The screenshot above explains the most basic of the interface. To understand it all
      we are creating a small tutorial here.
    </p>

    <h1>Creating a connection</h1>
    <p>
      Right click on the root item (the little blue globe named &quot;Connections&quot;) in
      the Connections panel and select &quot;New Connection&quot;. Or use the keybinding
      <kbd>Ctrl+N</kbd> if the Connections are selected.
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshots/Reference/new_connection.png">
    <p>
      A new item shows up under the root item. You can give it a name now
      (or rename it later). Here we just name it &quot;Test&quot;.
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshots/Reference/new_connection_test_item.png">
    <p>
      Now lets look at the Config panel in the bottom left, just under the
      Connections panel.
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshots/Reference/config_panel_01.png">
    <p>
      As you may notice this is where you configure all the properties of connections
      and folders.<br>
      There are a lot of values that can be set but for our first connection we will
      keep things simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most important things right now are that we tell the application which host
      we want to connect to and which protocol we want to use.<br>
      In this example we will use a Windows 2012 R2 server that has RDP (Remote Desktop
      Protocol) enabled.<br>
      As RDP is the default protocol whenever you create a new connection we don&#39;t have
      to change anything there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing we will do is to fill in the Hostname/IP field with the hostname
      we want to connect to. Lets also fill in a username and password so that we login
      automatically to the server.
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshots/Reference/config_panel_02.png">
    <p>
      Lets now try to connect to the server.
    </p>
    <div class="isa_info">
      <b>TIP!</b> You can see an indicator in the properties window that is glowing green.
      <img src="Screenshots/Reference/status_icon.png">
      <br><br>
      This icon does a ICMP ping on to check response from the server. If it glows green
      it indicates a connection response can be made using ping to the host.
      However this is turned off on windows by default. You have to enable ICMP and allow
      the firewall access for it.
    </div>
    <h1>Opening and Closing Connections</h1>
    <p>
      There are multiple ways to open a connection in mRemoteNG, but the easiest
      way is to double click the connection in the Connections panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you double click the connection you will notice that the connection is going
      to try and open in a new panel called &nbsp;General&nbsp; and under a tab
      called &nbsp;Test&nbsp;.
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshots/Reference/open_connection.png">
    <div class="isa_info">
      <b>NOTE!</b> If the connection fails you will find out what the problem was
      in the dialog notifications panel.
    </div>
    <p>
      If all goes well you should see the remote desktop without any problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      To close the connection you can do any of the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Log off in the start menu - Closes the connection and logs you out completely from RDP</li>
        <li>Close the panel with the - Which leaves your session active on server but closes connection in mRemoteNG</li>
        <li>Close the connection tab with - Also keeps your login active on server but closes RDP connection in mRemoteNG</li>
        <li>Double click the connection tab - Same as above where the connection is active on server but closes RDP connection in mRemoteNG</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Folders and Inheritance</h1>
    <p>
      Folders on mRemoteNG cannot only be used to categorize connections but also to
      apply properties to the underlying connections.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
      You have 10 Remote Desktop enabled servers in one domain and 15 in another domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally you would spend a lot of time creating all those connections and setting
      the individual properties like username, password, etc. In mRemoteNG there is an
      easier way. You just create two folders, one for domain A and one for domain B
      and set all properties there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then create the Connections and let them inherit every property. The only
      properties left to fill on Connection basis are the Connections name and hostname.
      Everything else will be inherited from the parent folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is how you do this:
    </p>
    <h3>1. Add the folder</h3>
    <p>
      This can be done with:
      <ul>
        <li>Right click on connections and click on <i>New Folder</i></li>
        <li><b>File > New Folder</b></li>
        <li>Or with keybinding: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+N</kbd></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshots/Reference/add_new_folder.png">
    <p>
      Then give it a name and fill all the properties you need (like you did with
      the test connection)
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshots/Reference/example_01.png"><br>
    <img src="Screenshots/Reference/example_02.png">
    <p>
      When you have filled in the settings and values you can either just drag the test
      Connection inside the folder or create a new one.
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshots/Reference/example_03.png">
    <p>
      Right now nothing has changed and nothing will be inherited.<br>
      To enable inheritance switch to the inheritance view by clicking the
      dedicated button. (Marked with a red arrow below)
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshots/Reference/example_04.png">
    <p>
      The properties that show up now are almost the same as before, but you
      only select yes or no to enable or disable a inheritance.
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshots/Reference/example_05.png">
    <p>
      When no is selected the property will not be inherited, yes indicates
      an inherited property.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this test set <i>Inherit Everything</i> to Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if you switch back to the properties view (the button left
      of the inheritance button) you should see that not much is left of all
      those properties.
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshots/Reference/example_06.png">
    <p>
      Only the Name and Hostname/IP properties are left over, everything else will be
      inherited from the parent folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course you can also only let some of the properties be inherited. Just play
      around with this a bit and you'll get the hang of it.
