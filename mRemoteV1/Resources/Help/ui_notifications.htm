      This will tell mRemoteNG what type of messages and the level of messages to send to the panel.
      It does not the level for the log that mRemoteNG has but only for panel output.
    </p>
    <p>There is also 2 different options mentioned below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Show these message types</b> - Level of messages to show in panel.
        (<b>default:</b> Warnings and Errors)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Switch to Notifications panel on</b> - If interface should switch to
        the panel when a level of message occurs (<b>default:</b> all enabled)
        <div class="isa_info">
          <b>TIP!</b> If you dont want the panel to show at all. Then unmark all options in
          <b>Switch to Notification panel on</b>. Then the panel will not come up automatic.

    <h2>Logging settings</h2>

      Here you define the logging of messages. That is a continues log which can be used to backtrack
      any error that has occurred. Good when for example reporting issues about mRemoteNG or to check
      more details about problems.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Log path</b> - Choose where the log should recide
        (<b>default:</b> Log to application directory)
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Log these message types</b> - Level of logging to logfile
        (<b>default:</b> Informations, Warnings, Errors)
      </li>
    </ul>
