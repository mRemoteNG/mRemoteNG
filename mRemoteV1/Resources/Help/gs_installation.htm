			<h2>Setup Package</h2>
			<p>
				The setup package is the compiled version of mRemoteNG which comes in an MSI installer.
				<br/>
				<i>-> The common way to get mRemoteNG up and running</i>
			</p>
			<h2>Portable Package</h2>
			<p>
				The portable package contains a modified version of the executable which stores and loads all your settings from files in the application&#39;s directory.
				<br/>
				This package can be used to run mRemoteNG off a portable device (a USB stick for example) and preserve your configuration wherever you go.
			</p>
			<h2>Source Package</h2>
			<p>
				The source package contains the source code as a zip file in form of a Visual Studio solution.
