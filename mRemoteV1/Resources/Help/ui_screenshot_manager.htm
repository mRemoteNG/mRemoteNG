		<h1>Screenshot Manager</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>The screenshot manager is a panel and tool that can be used to organize	and take screenshots inside mRemoteNG.</p>
		<!-- Take a screenshort - #start -->
		<h1>Take a screenshot</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>To take a screenshot of a instance its as easy as to right click on the	connection tab and press <b>Screenshot</b> and it will open the screenshot	manager.</p>
		<img src="Screenshots/Screenshot Manager/rightclick_screenshot.png"/>
		<img src="Screenshots/Screenshot Manager/screenshot_manager.png"/>
		<p>On the left image you will see the right click menu for the connection tab. Clicking the	screenshot there will allow mRemoteNG to create a screenshot.</p>
		<p>The right image is where the screenshots are stored in mRemoteNG. Here you can store	and then decide what to do with the images after you are done taking screenshots.</p>
		<!-- Take a screenshot - #end -->
		<!-- Manager - #start -->
		<h1>Editing</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>The manager is a simple tool for saving and deleting screenshots. If you need to do	more with the screenshots then the suggestion is to open them in a third party app.	Here is what the manager allows you to do:<ul>
				<li>Save</li>
				<li>Save All</li>
				<li>Delete</li>
				<li>Delete All</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Once you press save, a window to save the files will come up where you want to save	the screenshots.</p>
		<p>Short summary of screenshot manager is that you can sit and create screenshots without	having to open a different manager all the time and instead let mRemoteNG create the	main screenshot which can be edited later on.</p>
		<!-- Manager - #end -->
