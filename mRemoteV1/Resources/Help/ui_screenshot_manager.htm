    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The screenshot manager is a panel and tool that can be used to organize
      and take screenshots inside mRemoteNG.
    </p>

    <!-- Take a screenshort - #start -->
    <h1>Take a screenshot</h1>
    <p>
      To take a screenshot of a instance its as easy as to right click on the
      connection tab and press <b>Screenshot</b> and it will open the screenshot
      manager.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the left image you will see the right click menu for the connection tab. Clicking the
      screenshot there will allow mRemoteNG to create a screenshot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The right image is where the screenshots are stored in mRemoteNG. Here you can store
      and then decide what to do with the images after you are done taking screenshots.
    </p>
    <!-- Take a screenshot - #end -->

    <!-- Manager - #start -->
    <h1>Editing</h1>
    <p>
      The manager is a simple tool for saving and deleting screenshots. If you need to do
      more with the screenshots then the suggestion is to open them in a third party app.
      Here is what the manager allows you to do:
      <ul>
        <li>Save</li>
        <li>Save All</li>
        <li>Delete</li>
        <li>Delete All</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you press save, a window to save the files will come up where you want to save
      the screenshots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Short summary of screenshot manager is that you can sit and create screenshots without
      having to open a different manager all the time and instead let mRemoteNG create the
      main screenshot which can be edited later on.
    </p>
