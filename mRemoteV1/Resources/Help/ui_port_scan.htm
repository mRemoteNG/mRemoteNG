      The Port Scan feature (under Tools > Port Scan) is similar to a nmap port scan.
      It will scan a range of IP addresses and to determine if specific mRemoteNG supported
      protocols are active. Hosts can then be bulk imported into mRemoteNG.

    <h1>Use Case</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      You've just inherited a new network with little to no documentation.
      Inputting a range of IP addresses and scanning your entire network
      should give you a good idea of what is currently online.
      Importing those devices will then give you a quick
      (relatively, scanning a large subnet will take a while) way to get into those devices.

    <h1>How to use</h1>
    <hr>
    <ol>
      <li>Start the Port Scan feature by clicking Tools > Port Scan in the menu bar.</li>
      <li>Input your Start IP and End IP of the range you'd like to scan.</li>
      <li>Enter the Start Port and End Port that mRemoteNG should test for.
        <div class="isa_info">
          <b>TIP!</b> If you leave this at the default of 0 & 0,
          the test will be for the default protocol ports that mRemoteNG supports.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Click Scan</li>
      <li>Wait. Possibly a long time.</li>
      <li>
        The table will populate, and eventually you'll get a notification that the scan has completed.
        Alternatively, you can press Stop to end the scan at any time.
      </li>
      <li>Change the dropdown to the protocol you'd like to import and click Import.</li>
