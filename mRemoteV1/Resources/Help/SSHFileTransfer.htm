  <p class="heading1">
    Introduction to SSH File Transfer
  </p>
  <p>
    SSH File Transfer functionality allows you to securely transfer files to a remote host over an encrypted tunnel using either SFTP or SCP.
  </p>

  <p class="heading1">
    Use Cases
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary use case is to upload individual files, such as configuration files, to a remote host.
  </p>

  <p class="heading1">Prerequisites</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SSH File Transfer requires an SSH service to listen on an available network port (default 22) on a remote host.</li>
    <li>A username and password must be supplied to connect with the remote host.</li>
    <li>The remote host must have a writeable folder on its filesystem to place the transferred files.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="heading1">Configuration Options</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Host</b> - The remote host you connect to. Can be DNS name or IP address.</li>
    <li><b>Port</b> - Remote network port listening for SSH/SFTP/SCP traffic.</li>
    <li><b>User</b> - Username for account to log on to remote host.</li>
    <li><b>Password</b> - Password for account to log on to remote host.</li>
    <li><b>Protocol</b> - Choice of SCP or SFTP protocol used for communication.</li>
    <li><b>Local File</b> - Path of file to transfer from local host.</li>
    <li><b>Remote File</b> - Path where file will be transferred on remote host.<br />
      Example: /home/John/Documents</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="heading1">Using SSH File Transfer</p>
  <p>
    To begin, select <b>Tools</b> and then <b>SSH File Transfer</b>. The tool will fill the window and allow you to input the configuration options. Each piece of information is needed for a successful transfer.
  </p>

  <p>
    To populate the <b>Local File</b> option, select the <b>Browse</b> button and navigate to the desired file on the local filesystem. To populate the <b>Remote File</b> option, manually type desired filesystem path, including the desired file name.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once all options are populated, select <b>Transfer</b> and the progress bar at the bottom of the window will show the progress.
  </p>

  <p class="heading1">Troubleshooting SSH File Transfer</p>
  <p>
    To troubleshoot issues with SSH File Transfer, consult the log under %AppData%\mRemoteNG\mRemoteNG.log. This log provides verbose information about successful and failed connections.

      Common Issues
    </span>
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>ERROR- Please fill all fields</b><br />
    This issue was likely encountered because you did not provide all information needed to establish the connection.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (0x80004005): No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it</b><br />
    This issue was likely encountered because the local host could not contact the remote host specified on the remote port specified.<br />
    The issue may be caused by improperly configured firewall rules or a SSH service not listening properly on the remote host.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>[14] ERROR- SSH background transfer failed!</b><br />
    This issue was likely encountered due to a permissions issue. Ensure you have appropriate access to write to the specified Remote File.
