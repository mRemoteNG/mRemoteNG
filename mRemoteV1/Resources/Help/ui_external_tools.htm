		<h1>External Tools</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			External Tools allow you to integrate external command-line tools or applications into mRemoteNG.
			<br/>
			The external tools configuration is stored in %APPDATA%\mRemoteNG\extApps.xml
		</p>
		<h1>Variables</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>Variables and arguments can be used to tell the external tool what to do.</p>
		<p>This is the list of variables supported by mRemoteNG:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>%NAME%</li>
			<li>%HOSTNAME%</li>
			<li>%PORT%</li>
			<li>%USERNAME%</li>
			<li>%PASSWORD%</li>
			<li>%DOMAIN%</li>
			<li>%DESCRIPTION%</li>
			<li>%MACADDRESS%</li>
			<li>%USERFIELD%</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Variables always refer to the currently selected connection. Variable names are case-insensitive. Variables can be used in both the Filename and Arguments fields.</p>
		<p>mRemoteNG will also expand environment variables such as %PATH% and %USERPROFILE%. If you need to use an environment variable with the same name as an mRemoteNG variable, use \% instead of %. The most common use of this is for the USERNAME environment variable. %USERNAME% will be expanded to the username of the credential record assigned to the currently selected connection. \%USERNAME\% will be expanded to the value set in the USERNAME environment variable.</p>
		<p>If you need to send a variable name to a program without mRemoteNG expanding it, use ^% instead of %. mRemoteNG will remove the caret (^) and leave the rest unchanged. For example, ^%USERNAME^% will be sent to the program as %USERNAME% and will not be expanded.</p>
		
		<h1>Referencing Credential Variables</h1>
		<hr/>
		<div class="isa_info">
			<b>Note:</b> For a credential variable (username, domain, password) to receive any value, the credential repository which holds the credential must be unlocked.
		</div>
		<p>When an external tool is run, the %USERNAME%, %DOMAIN%, and %PASSWORD% variables take their values from the credential record assigned to the currently selected connection. It is also possible to reference a specific credential record in an external tool. This way, the same credential can be used for a tool regardless of which connection is currently selected in the connection tree.</p>
		<p>To reference a specific credential record, append the credential record ID to the variable like shown below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>%USERNAME:ID%</li>
			<li>%DOMAIN:ID%</li>
			<li>%PASSWORD:ID%</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Credential record IDs can be found within the credential manager. Once a value has been retrieved for a variable, normal special character escaping applies (see the section on Special Character Escaping for details).</p>

		<ul>
			<li>At least 7 characters of the ID must be provided, though you can provide as many as you would like up to the maximum 32 characters. Providing more characters reduces the chances of an ID collision.
				<ul>
					<li><code>%USERNAME:D1C198F%</code> is equivalent to <code>%USERNAME:D1C198F457D74F48%</code>, which is equivalent to <code>%USERNAME:D1C198F457D74F48808FE1724BECB291%</code></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Including dashes (-) is fine as they will be stipped out when performing the lookup.
				<ul>
					<li><code>%USERNAME:D1C198F4-57D7-4F48-808F-E1724BECB291%</code> is the same as <code>%USERNAME:D1C198F457D74F48808FE1724BECB291%</code></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The ID is case insensitive
				<ul>
					<li><code>%USERNAME:D1C198F%</code> is the same as <code>%USERNAME:d1c198f%</code></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Special Character Escaping</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>Expanded variables will be escaped using the rules below. There are two levels of escaping that are done. The first is escaping for standard argument splitting (C/C++ argv, CommandLineToArgvW, etc). The second is escaping shell metacharacters for ShellExecute.</p>
		<div class=lvl1>
			<h2>Argument splitting escaping:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Each quotation mark will be escaped by a backslash.</li>
				<li>One or more backslashes (\) followed by a quotation mark ("):<ul>
						<li>Each backslash will be escaped by another backslash.</li>
						<li>The quotation mark will be escaped by a backslash.</li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the connection's user field contains &quot;This&quot; is a \"test\&quot;.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then %USERFIELD% is replaced with \&quot;This\&quot; is a \\\&quot;test\\\&quot;.</ul>
				</li>
				<li>A variable name followed by a quotation mark (for example, %USERFIELD%&quot;) with a value ending in one or more backslashes:<ul>
						<li>Each backslash will be escaped by another backslash.</li>
						<li>Example:</li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the connection's user field contains c:\Example\<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then "%USERFIELD%" is replaced with "c:\Example\\"</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To disable argument splitting escaping for a variable, precede its name with a minus (-) sign. For example, %-USERFIELD%.</p>
			<h2>Shell metacharacter escaping:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>The shell metacharacters are ( ) % ! ^ &quot; &lt; &gt; &amp; |</li>
				<li>Each shell metacharacter will be escaped by a caret (^).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To disable both argument splitting and shell metacharacter escaping for a variable, precede its name with an exclamation point (!). For example, %!USERFIELD%. This is not recommended and may cause unexpected results.</p>
			<p>Only variables that have been expanded will be escaped. It is up to you to escape the rest of the arguments.</p>

		<h1>Example</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>First of all, start the external tools editor. To do this, click Tools in the main menu and select External Tools.<br/>You will see a screen like on the following screenshot.</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="" src="Screenshots/External Tools/01.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The fields below the list are greyed out because you haven&#39;t created an external tool entry yet.<br/>To create one, right click the blank area in the list and select Add, as in the screenshot below.</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="" src="Screenshots/External Tools/02.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>This is what you&#39;ll get:</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="" src="Screenshots/External Tools/03.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>So the three fields are now available and need to be filled.<br/>The Display Name is simply the name you will see when you want to launch that tool, so give it a descriptive name.<br/>I named mine Traceroute as I will create a external tool that will start the tracert command in the console.</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="" src="Screenshots/External Tools/04.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Ok, the next thing we&#39;ll need is a filename. This is the program that we want to be executed.<br/>I simply type in cmd for a Windows cmd console.</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="" src="Screenshots/External Tools/05.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The Windows cmd has a command line argument that tells the console to launch the command followed by that argument and stay open.<br/>It&#39;s /K. (There&#39;s also /C, this is useful when you want the console to close after the command was executed)<br/>In this case, I&#39;ll use /K as I want to look through the result when the command completes.<br/>After that, I just type tracert %HostName%. This tells the console to do a traceroute on the hostname of the currently selected Connection.</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="" src="Screenshots/External Tools/06.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Now right click one of you connections, click Tools, External Tools and select Traceroute.</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="" src="Screenshots/External Tools/07.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Voilà! A console window will popup and execute your tracert command.</p>
		<p>
