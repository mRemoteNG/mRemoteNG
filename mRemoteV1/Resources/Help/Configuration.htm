<p class="heading1">
    First start
</p>
<p>
    Once you got mRemote installed and run it for the first time you should see a
    screen like on the following screenshot.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/01.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    The first thing that catches your attention will probably be the info box
    popping up.<br/>
    Don&#39;t freak out just yet, this is not a error message and it&#39;s totally ok to
    show up on the first run.<br/>
    It just tells you that the connections file could not be found at the default
    location and that mRemote will create a new one for you at this location.<br/>
    If you click anywhere else in the application the panel will hide itself again.
    (Tip: You can also hit Escape to hide the Errors and Infos panel)
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/02.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    Now that we now about the Errors and Infos panel take a deep breath and just
    stare at the gorgeous about screen for a few seconds. =)<br/>
    No, seriously, to create your first connection continue reading.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="heading1">Creating Connections</span></p>
<p>
    Right click the root item (the blue ball labeled &quot;Connections&quot;) in the
    Connections panel and select &quot;Add Connection&quot;.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/03.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    A new item shows up under the root item. You can give it a name now (or rename
    it later). I just named mine &quot;Test&quot;.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/04.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    Now have a look at the Config panel in the bottom left, just under the
    Connections panel.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/05.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    As you may notice this is where you configure all the properties of connections
    and folders.<br/>
    There are a lot of values that can be set but for our first connection we will
    keep things simple.
</p>
<p>
    The most important things right now are that we tell the application which host
    we want to connect to and which protocol we want to use.<br/>
    In this example I will use a Windows 2003 server that has RDP (Remote Desktop
    Protocol) enabled.<br/>
    As RDP is the default protocol whenever you create a new connection I don&#39;t have
    to change anything there.
</p>
<p>
    The next thing I&#39;ll do is to fill the Hostname/IP field with the hostname I
    want to connect to.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/06.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    I&#39;ll also fill the Username and Password fields so I will be automatically
    logged on to the server.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/07.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    Ok, that&#39;s it, we are ready for our first connection test.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="heading1">Opening and Closing Connections</span></p>
<p>
    There are multiple ways to open a connection in mRemote, but the easiest is to
    just double-click the connection in the Connections panel.
</p>
<p>
    If I do that now, a new panel named &quot;General&quot; with one tab inside named &quot;Test&quot;
    will show up.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/08.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    Alright, mRemote is now trying to connect to the specified host.
</p>
<p>
    If it cannot connect you will see a message popping up like on the following
    screenshot.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/17.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    This for example means the hostname cannot be resolved.
</p>
<p>
    Instead, if all goes well you should see the remote desktop.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/09.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    If you do not want to log off from the remote machine but just close it you can
    do this by simply double-clicking the tab labeled &quot;test&quot; or just close the whole
    &quot;General&quot; panel by clicking the small &quot;x&quot; in the upper right corner.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="heading1">Folders and Inheritance</span></p>
<p>
    Folders in mRemote cannot only be used to categorize connections but also to
    apply properties to the underlying connections.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b><br/>
    You have 10 Remote Desktop enabled servers in one domain and 15 in another
    domain.<br/>
    Normally you would spend a lot of time creating all those connections and
    setting the individual properties like username, password, etc.<br/>
    In mRemote there is an easier way. You just create two folders, one for domain A
    and one for domain B and set all properties there.<br/>
    Then create the Connections and let them inherit every property. The only
    properties left to fill on Connection basis are the Connection&#39;s name and
    hostname. Everything else will be inherited from the parent folder.
</p>
<p>
    &quot;Sounds cool, but how to do it?&quot;<br/>
    I&#39;ll show you how to do it!
</p>
<p>
    First add a new folder.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/10.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    Then give it a name and fill all the properties you need (just like you did with
    the test Connection).
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/11.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/12.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    When you&#39;re done setting the values you can either just drag the test Connection
    inside the folder or create a new one.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/13.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    Right now nothing has changed and nothing will be inherited.<br/>
    To enable inheritance switch to the inheritance view by clicking the dedicated
    button.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/14.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    The properties that show up now are almost the same as before, but you can only
    select yes or no.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/15.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    When no is selected the property will not be inherited, yes indicates an
    inherited property.<br/>
    For this test set &quot;Inherit Everything&quot; to Yes.
</p>
<p>
    Now if you switch back to the properties view (the button left of the
    inheritance button) you should see that not much is left of all those
    properties.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="Screenshots/Configuration/16.png"/>
</p>
<p>
    Only the Name and Hostname/IP properties are left over, everything else will be
    inherited from the parent folder.<br/>
    Of course you can also only let some of the properties be inherited.
</p>
<p>
    Just play around with this a bit and you&#39;ll get the hang of it.
