    <p>
      mRemoteNG is using panels and tabs to stay organized but also to create a better
      view of all multitasking that is being done inside the application. Because
      of that it can be good to know some more information on how to work with panels
      and tabs to get the most out of those features.
    </p>
    <h2>Panels</h2>
    <p>
      Panels are used to organize tabbed connections. This might seem
      a bit confusing but its a great way to stay organized. Below is a few examples
      of how to use panels to give you a hands on better view of them.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Test and Production</i> - You can add 2 panels where you have the test servers
        are located and the other where production servers are running.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Datacenters</i> - Maybe you divide them into datacenters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Temp project</i> - To see all servers you work on for a temporary project.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Home vs Work</i> - Maybe you are sneaky at work and want to login at home to
        check you machine at home for something while keeping work in its own panel.
      </li>
      <li>
        ...and many more
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For this tutorial we will keep it simple with Domain A and Domain B. Where both
      have their own panels.

    <h3>Creating panels</h3>
    <p>
      Usually panels are created using connections and folders to stay organized
      automatic when making connections. However you can also create panels manually.
      See below:
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshots/Navigation/view_menu.png">
    <p>
      Creating manual panels will make you able to organize tabs manually in mRemoteNG.
      To then open a connection to the new panel then Right click on connection and use
      <b>"Connect (with options)" > Choose panel before connecting</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The other option in the menu named <b>"Connection Panels"</b> will list all panels
      in open in the current running mRemoteNG window.
    </p>
    <h3>More options</h3>
    <p>
      Right click menu for panels will give you a few more options for the panels:
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshots/Navigation/panel_context_menu.png">
    <ul>
      <li><b>Rename</b> - Rename the panel</li>
      <li>
        <b>Send To...</b> - Send the whole panel to monitor/screen [number]. Note this
        is not a real window but a detachable panel. So if you double click the title
        the panel will go back to mRemoteNG and not fullscreen the window.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tabs</h2>
    <p>
      Speaking plain the tabs are also the connections that is open in mRemoteNG.
      There are few tips and tricks regarding tabs and we will try to list them here.
      In the below examples we will give you examples of RDP and SSH connections.
    </p>
    <h3>Right click conext menu</h3>
    <p>
      The right click context menu allows you to trigger som additional actions on
      tabs for example: Rename Tab, Duplicate Tab, Reconnect, Disconnect etc. Below
      are the two context menus from RDP and SSH.
    </p>
    <div style="display: inline-block;">
      <h3>RDP context menu</h3>
      <img src="Screenshots/Navigation/rdp_context_menu.png">
    </div>
    <div style="display: inline-block;">
      <h3>SSH context menu</h3>
      <img src="Screenshots/Navigation/ssh_context_menu.png">
    </div>
    <p>
      If you check the difference between the menus you can see that there are some
      actions that differ depending on the connection. This is intentional since its
      specific for the type of connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default and always available menu items are:
      <ul>
        <li><i>Screenshot</i> - Create a screenshot to Screenshot Manager</li>
        <li><i>External Tools</i> - Run external tool script/action</li>
        <li><i>Rename Tab</i> - Rename current tab</li>
        <li><i>Duplicate Tab</i> - Duplicate tab connection</li>
        <li><i>Reconnect</i> - Reconnect the current tab</li>
        <li>
          <i>Disconnect</i> - Disconnect the current tab (Double clicking the tab
          will also disconnect the current tab. If you want to change this action then
          go to <b>Tools > Options > Tabs & Panels</b> and uncheck
          <i>"Double click on tab closes it"</i>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      Click around and try it out. You will get the hang of it.
