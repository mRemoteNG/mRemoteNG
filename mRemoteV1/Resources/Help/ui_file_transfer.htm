    <h2>Common Issues</h2>
    <br><br>
    <b>ERROR- Please fill all fields</b>
    <br>
    This issue was likely encountered because you did not provide all information needed to establish the connection.
    <br><br>
    <b>System.Net.Sockets.SocketException (0x80004005): No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it</b>
    <br>
    This issue was likely encountered because the local host could not contact the remote host specified on the remote port specified.
    <br>
    The issue may be caused by improperly configured firewall rules or a SSH service not listening properly on the remote host.
    <br><br>
    <b>[14] ERROR- SSH background transfer failed!</b>
    <br>
    This issue was likely encountered due to a permissions issue. Ensure you have appropriate access to write to the specified Remote File.
