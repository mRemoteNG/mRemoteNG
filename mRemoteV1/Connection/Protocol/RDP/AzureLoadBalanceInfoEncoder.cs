            // UTF-16 encoded strings by default.  The following code converts
            // the UTF-16 encoded string so that the byte-representation of the
            // LoadBalanceInfo string object will "appear" as UTF-8 to the Active component.
            // Furthermore, since the final string still has to be shoehorned into
            // a UTF-16 encoded string, I pad an extra space in case the number of
            // bytes would be odd, in order to prevent the byte conversion from
            // mangling the string at the end.  The space is ignored by the RDP
            // protocol as long as it is inserted at the end.
            // Finally, it is required that the LoadBalanceInfo setting is postfixed
            // with \r\n in order to work properly.  Note also that \r\n MUST be
            // the last two characters, so the space padding has to be inserted first.
            // The following code has been tested with Windows Azure connections
            // only - I am aware there are other types of RDP connections that
            // require the LoadBalanceInfo parameter which I have not tested
            // (e.g., Multi-Server Terminal Services Gateway), that may or may not
            // work properly.
