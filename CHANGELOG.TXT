Added startup components check with directions to fix component installation (also available in Tools - Components Check)
Added "Try to integrate" option to Ext. Apps. If enabled mRemote will try to integrate the app into a tab container like any other connection protocol.
Added Ext. App as protocol. Any Ext. App can be launched just like a normal connection.
Example (DameWare Mini Remote Control):
Create a new Ext. App with the following properties:
Display Name: DameWare
Filename: c:\PathToYourDameWareInstallDir\DWRCC.exe
Arguments: -c: -h: -m:%hostname% -u:%username% -p:"%password%" -d:%domain%
Options: Try to integrate
Create a new connection and select Ext. App as protocol
Then choose DameWare in the Ext. App field
If you have problems with a particular app that takes a long time to start up consider setting a higher PuTTY/Ext. Apps wait time in Tools - Options - Advanced
Added option to completely encrypt connection files (tools - options - advancecd)
Added Rendering Engine option for HTTP/S protocols
You can now use the Gecko (Firefox) rendering engine
For this to work you need to download xulrunner (get it here: ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/xulrunner/releases/1.8.1.3/contrib/win32/)
It must be the 1.8.1.3 release, 1.9.0.0 does NOT work!
Extract the contents to a path of your choice and set the correct path in Tools - Options - Advanced - XULrunner path
The interface is tab enabled and usage is generally very firefox-like. So you can open new tabs with Ctrl+T, jump to the location bar with Ctrl+L and so on...

Added descriptions for all fields in the config editor
Fixed bug in connections loading code when using SQL storage

V1.00:
Merry Christmas! =)

V1.00 is a (almost) complete rewrite of the whole application
The code base is now much cleaner and more (easily) extendable
New features include (but are not limited to):
Every part of the application is now integrated into panels which can be moved, docked and undocked, hidden, moved to another monitor, etc.
This makes many new and exciting ways to manage connection and application windows possible
You can for example open up 4 PuTTY sessions in 4 different panels and align them in the main application so you can use all 4 side by side - 2 on the upper side and 2 on the bottom for example
This can be done for EVERY part of the application, it's completely modular and customizable
Connection and folder (previously called containers) properties have moved to a new property grid control
Every setting (with the exclusion of the hostname, which wouldn't make any sense) can now be inherited from the parent folder
Connection file saving/loading is now handled a bit different (more in the help section)
Application restart is no longer nececary after changing options, they are active with a click of the OK button
Smart size can now be activated also if a connection is already open (in the right click menu of the active tab)
A panel name can be stored with every connection (or folder, if inherting) to always open the connection in the specified panel
And last but not least, many bugs have been fixed, though there are probably many new bugs aswell - Did I already mention this is a rewrite? ;)
I hope you like my work and if you do please consider donating on the mRemote website to support me a little. Any amount will do! Thx!

V0.50:
Removed old Terminal (SSH, Telnet) control and embedded PuTTY instead
This decision brings mostly good but also some bad news
The good news is that now everything that works in putty also works in mRemote
This means X11 forwarding, SSH port forwarding, session logging, appearance customization, etc. should be working fine now
It also brings some new protocols (Rlogin, RAW)
The bad news is that I cannot fully integrate Putty into mRemote because it is a standalone application and thus has it's own window handle
This means that you won't be able to use Ctrl+Tab to switch between tabs, catching errors or infos through the new Errors and Infos tab isn't possible, etc.
Added possibility to change resolution or display mode (Fit to window, Fullscreen, Smart size)
Added new setting in options to show logon info on tab titles
Added new feature that catches popup dialogs and puts them in a managed interface. This is another step to make mRemote a single window application.
Pressing escape switches back to the connection list
There is a context menu that allows you to copy selected errors/warnings/infos to the clipboard (text only) or to delete them
There also are settings in the option to change when to switch to the tab and to switch back to the normal behaviour of displaying message popups
Added QuickConnect history and auto-complete functions
Added a few new Icons (Linux, Windows, ESX, Log, Finance)
Improved options tab
Connections file version is now 1.2
Fixed some form drawing bugs

V0.35:
Added tab switching/closing hotkeys
Switch to next tab: Ctrl+Tab
Switch to previous tab: Ctrl+Shift+Tab
Close active tab: Ctrl+W
This does not and will probably never work with RDP connections!
Fixed bug in updating code that still displayed the current version in the old format (x.x.x.x instead of x.xx)
Fixed bug where the colors setting was not correctly read after saving and reloading a connections file (only with 256 colors setting)
Fixed bug that made connect to console session and fullscreen options not work
