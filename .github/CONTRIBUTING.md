**Hello, and welcome to the mRemoteNG project!**

Open source software is best when shared with others. This also applies to the work that goes into the software. Your ideas and passion are what make this software great!
There are many ways that you can help improve mRemoteNG, even if you don't know how to program:

- add documentation or "how-to" articles on the Wiki
- answer support questions on the forum
- add or improve a translation
- submit a pull request for a bug or feature ticket

The GitHub Issue tracker is our preferred channel for bug reports and feature requests.
For questions or general discussion, please use [our public Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/mRemoteNG/PublicChat) or the [forum](http://forum.mremoteng.org).

If you find a security vulnerability, do **NOT** open an issue. Email security@mremoteng.org instead.
